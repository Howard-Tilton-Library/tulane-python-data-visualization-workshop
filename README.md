## Workshop Review

The first half of the workshop, including the introduction to Python, as well as plotting using the `matplotlib` library, is primarily based on the Software Carpentries workshop: [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). Please review lesson one (Running and Quitting) through lesson nine (Plotting) for a thorough review of the materials covered during the workshop. 

For more background in developing foundational coding and data science skills please refer to other lessons available through the Software Carpentries: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/
